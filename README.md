# COGS108_FinalProject
This repository contains my final project for COGS 108 - Data Science in Practice. 

Using census data from ipums.org, we studied the relationship between California employees' income and their age, gender, race, education, occupation, and city size. We also examined if controllable factors (age/gender/race) or uncontrollable factors (education/occupation/city size) are more impactful on wages. Overall, we found the controllable factors to have a much higher correlation with income than the uncontrollable factors. The results of this study is pretty consistent with our hypothesis and social norm.

This project is completed together with Jiahe Liu, Guanxin Li, and Shirley Zhang. See the final project notebook for detailed contributions.
